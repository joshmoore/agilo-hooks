These are modifications of the agilo post-commit hooks
which add support for multiple Trac repositories (+0.12).
Throughout the code are hard-coded values for the OME trac
instance (http://trac.openmicroscopy.org/ome), so only use
these files as templates to base your own changes on.

This code may have already been included in later agilo
releases as https://dev.agile42.com/ticket/1086 is already
closed.

Directions
==========

 * Configuration a bare git (/home/git/ome.git):

    [core]
        repositoryformatversion = 0
        filemode = true
        bare = true
        sharedrepository = 1
    [receive]
        denyNonFastforwards = true

 * Link the post-receive under hooks:

    ln -s `pwd`/post-receive /home/git/ome.git/hooks

 * (optional) If you need post-commit instead, see
   spec-post-commit. (Not used in production)

Things to note
==============

 * agilo_svn_hook_commit.py has been modified to use
   the omero_svn_hooks.py module. Upgrades to your
   agilo installation will NOT change this behavior.
   You will need to merge by hand.

 * In post-receive, only certain branches are handled.
   This allows temporary branches to be located on the
   same repository without having tickets modified.

 * omero_svn_hooks.py has several lines marked
   "OMERO-specific behavior", which permits tickets to
   be closed by non-authors even when they are not in
   the "assigned" status.
